\begin{itemize}
    \item 2-week sprint cycles
    \item Daily standups and retrospectives
    \item Sprint planning and review sessions
    \item Product backlog management
\end{itemize}
\end{sprintbox}

\begin{sprintbox}{Machine Learning Experimentation}
AI-specific processes ensure model quality and performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model experimentation and validation cycles
    \item Data pipeline development and testing
    \item Algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning
    \item Performance benchmarking and optimization
\end{itemize}
